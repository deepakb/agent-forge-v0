# Agent Forge

Agent Forge is a powerful, enterprise-grade framework for building, managing, and orchestrating AI agents. It provides a robust foundation for creating autonomous agents that can handle complex tasks, communicate with each other, and maintain state across distributed systems.

## 🌟 Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Built with a modular design across three main packages:
  - `@agent-forge/core`: Core agent functionality and base implementations
  - `@agent-forge/llm-provider`: LLM integration for AI capabilities
  - `@agent-forge/shared`: Shared utilities and common functionality

- **Advanced Agent Management**:
  - Lifecycle management (initialize, start, pause, resume, stop)
  - Concurrent task handling
  - State management and persistence
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Heartbeat monitoring

- **Robust Task Handling**:
  - Task queuing and execution
  - Progress tracking
  - Error handling and retry mechanisms
  - Task status monitoring

- **State Management**:
  - Redis-based state persistence
  - State synchronization across distributed systems
  - Event-based state updates
  - Transaction support

- **Communication**:
  - Message broker system
  - Pub/Sub messaging patterns
  - Reliable message delivery
  - Event emission and handling

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
npm install @agent-forge/core @agent-forge/llm-provider @agent-forge/shared
```

2. Create a basic agent:
```typescript
import { BaseAgent } from '@agent-forge/core';

class MyAgent extends BaseAgent {
  protected async executeTask(task: Task): Promise<TaskResult> {
    // Implement your task execution logic
  }
  
  // Implement other required abstract methods
}
```

## 🛠️ Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-forge.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

npm install
```

3. Build all packages:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```
